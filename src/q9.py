Question 9 — GitHub: Git Workflow  [Short Answer]

This is the same workflow you used to SUBMIT this assessment, so you have
already done most of it. Write the exact git command for each step.

Scenario
--------
You have a local copy of a repo. You want to:
1. Create a new branch called `my-solutions`.
2. Switch to that branch.
3. After editing `q4.md`, stage that file for commit.
4. Commit the staged change with the message "Add Q4 answers".
5. Push the `my-solutions` branch to GitHub.

Write the exact git command for each step (one per line).
"""
I use point and click. I am not familiar and would like to learn more on this.

# Step 1 — Create a new branch called `my-solutions`:
git branch my-solutions

# Step 2 — Switch to `my-solutions`:
git switch my-solutions

# Step 3 — Stage q4.md:
git add src/q4.md
    or if I am in the src folder, git add q4.md

# Step 4 — Commit with message "Add Q4 answers":
git commit -m "Add Q4 answers"

# Step 5 — Push `my-solutions` to the remote:
git push -u origin my-solutions

"""
Step 6 (short answer). You run `git status` and it says
`Changes not staged for commit`. In one sentence, what does that tell you,
and which command moves a file from there into the next commit?

    Answer: The file has changed but not yet commit. The git add <filename> command stages the file so that it will be included in the next commit.
